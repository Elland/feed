Interfacing with RSS (v 0.9x, 2.x, 1.0) + Atom feeds.

To help working with the multiple feed formats we've ended up with,
this set of modules provides parsers, pretty printers and some utility
code for querying and just generally working with a concrete
representation of feeds in Haskell.

For basic reading and editing of feeds, consult the documentation of
the Text.Feed.* hierarchy.
